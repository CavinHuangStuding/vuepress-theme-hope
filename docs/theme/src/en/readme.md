### vuepress-theme-hope is a light vuepress theme

### Install

```bash
npm i -D vuepress-theme-hope
```

### Usage

```js
// .vuepress/config.js
const resolve = require('vuepress-theme-hope/resolve');

module.exports = resolve({
  // your config here
});
```

::: tip Why using `resolve` function
**vuepress-theme-hope** is extendsng from the official default theme. In order to reduce user configuration as much as possible, **vuepress-theme-hope** provides some additional configuration options that need to be processed before submitting to the official theme. In addition, **vuepress-theme-hope** will also automatically generate some configurations for you, such as automatically selecting the multi-language options in your theme configuration, generating the multi-language options in the project configuration for you, and automatically helping you complete the localization work.
