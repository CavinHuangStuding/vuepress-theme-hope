# Page Enhance

## Picture Preview

We supports clicking to preview and zooming the picture, while supporting the sliding browsing of the page picture and the sharing and downloading of the picture too. You can set `themeConfig.photoSwipe` to `false` to disable it.

For more options, please see [photo-swipe plugin configuration][photo-swipe]
